Types of Primary Keys

Surrogate Keys: Have no relation to anything in the "real world," 
but uniquely identify a particular row in the database.`

Natural Keys: Have a relation to the "real world" and uniquely 
identify a row within the database. Example might be a SSN.

Foreign Keys: Attribute that can be stored in a database
table to link it to another database table. A Foreign Keys
in one table is a Primary Key in a different table. 
A table can have more than one foreign branch.

Composite Key: Has two attributes (columns) that will uniquely
identify each row in the table.
